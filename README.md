HeroHire: A Dapper Dingos Joint

![alt tag](http://i62.tinypic.com/2vxmzdc.jpg)

An MEAN stack application that employs the Materialize frontend framework to create a centralized application for users to post local jobs asking for volunteers.  Users who complete jobs can be awarded Karma points, which helps rank the outreach of community participants.  Highly rated personnel are given special access to have their own job requests placed prominently in the application, which encourages sincere utilization of HeroHire. 

This application utilizes [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), and [Materilize](http://materializecss.com/).

## Credits
Inspired by the need for all people to safely ask for help to complete various tasks and chores locally through a centralized and controlled network of dedicated individuals.
