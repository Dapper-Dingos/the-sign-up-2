There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## An outreach hub powered by volunteerism. ##
  
## Problem ##
  In this digital age, people often forget the trials their neighbors endure on a daily basis.  Despite the ability to communicate with an endless online population, tangible problems - large and small - still arise throughout life.  There is no centralized location to ask for - and receive - help when it is really needed, which hurts communities worldwide.  The elderly, alone, and disabled often have little available options when completing tasks such as shopping for groceries, raking leaves, and other jobs.  They need help; we all sometimes do.

## Solution ##
  HeroHire sets out to ease the life of the needy through a powerful volunteer based communal network that encourages helping  neighbors.  Once logged in, users can post jobs that they need completed through a clean, simple interface.  Authenticated users can volunteer through each posting, cultivating a powerful local support system. 

## Quote from You ##
  "We have found that despite options such as Google, Craigslist, Facebook, and countless other social networks being available, there was no easy way to ask for someone to simply ask for help.  As we have moved further into an always-on, always-connected era, personal communication has become inversely absent, resulting in further isolation between people living within the same neighborhoods, towns, and cities.  HeroHire helps remove these boundaries and give users a safe, effective set of tools to ask for and receive help.  It also rewards those who continually demonstrate their sincerety, encouraging a social network to be extended into the tangible world."

## How to Get Started ##
  Users can access https://herohire.herokuapp.com, sign up with their existing Twitter, Gmail, or Facebook accounts, and  immediately begin posting jobs or helping enrich the lives of those around them. 

## Customer Quote ##
  "In my advanced age, it's always difficult to complete some of the chores around my house, which is an unfortunate byproduct of living alone.  Thankfully, HeroHire gives me the chance to ask for help.  People show up with smiles on their faces and happily take care of whatever I need.  It's so nice to know that there are still people who care in this world, willing to take time out of their day to help strangers in need."
